### 🔹 About Me

I'm a passionate frontend developer with a strong focus on scalable web applications using Angular and React. Known for my autonomy, adaptability, and product-oriented mindset, I’ve led frontend development in SaaS platforms, government solutions, and startups (often as the sole frontend in the team).

My proudest achievement: I launched a multi-app SaaS in just 7 months, succeeding where four years of previous attempts had failed.

Currently driving the growth of complex SaaS platforms and enterprise systems, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, performance, and user experience.
