### 🔹 About Me

I'm a passionate frontend developer with a strong focus on scalable web applications using Angular and React. Known for my autonomy, adaptability, and product-oriented mindset, I’ve led frontend development in SaaS platforms, government solutions, and startups—often as the sole frontend in the team.

My proudest achievement: I launched a multi-app SaaS in just 7 months, succeeding where four years of previous attempts had failed.

Currently contributing to both public-sector platforms and startup growth, I'm now open to long-term opportunities that value clean architecture, performance, and user experience.
